# Proposal: Improve Bazi Input UI

## Summary
Update the Bazi Input component's header text and input placeholders to be more descriptive and dynamic, showing the current date/GanZhi as examples.

## Motivation
To provide clearer instructions to the user and helpful context by showing the current time as a reference.

## Goals
- Center the header text "请输入命主八字（支持输入时间或者具体八字）".
- Dynamically calculate the current date and Bazi.
- Set input placeholders to format: "Year/GanZhi", "Month/GanZhi", etc. (e.g., "2026/乙巳").
