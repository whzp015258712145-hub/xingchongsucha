# Visual Design Specs

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Human Section Column Labels
The column labels in the "Human" (Ren) section MUST be rendered as text elements (e.g., `span`) to match the "Heaven" (Tian) section's visual style.
#### Scenario: Consistent Styling
User views the chart; the Year, Month, Day, and Hour labels under "Human" look identical to those under "Heaven" (no button borders/backgrounds).

### Requirement: Dayun Label Interaction
The 'Luck' (Dayun) label MUST remain interactive (clickable) to toggle gender, but should visually integrate with the other labels.
#### Scenario: Toggle Gender
User clicks "Male Luck" / "Female Luck"; the gender toggles.
