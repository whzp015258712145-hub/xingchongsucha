# Prepare for Launch (Metadata & Configuration)

## Summary
This proposal optimizes the application for a production launch by populating essential metadata. It focuses on SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Social Media previews (Open Graph), and Mobile Web App capabilities. It also establishes the project version as 1.0.0.

## Goals
- **SEO & Discoverability**: Add description and keywords to help search engines understand the tool.
- **Social Sharing**: Ensure the link looks professional when shared on WeChat, Telegram, or Twitter/X (Open Graph).
- **Mobile Experience**: Enable "Add to Home Screen" optimizations for iOS/Android to enhance the "tool" feel.
- **Project Identity**: align `package.json` metadata with the product identity.

## Non-Goals
- Changing any application logic, algorithms, or React components.
- Modifying visual styles (CSS/Tailwind).
- Performance tuning of the calculation engine (deemed sufficient for MVP).
