# Spec: Increase Chart Spacing

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Zen Visual Style
The application MUST use generous whitespace to create a calm, premium "Zen" aesthetic in the analysis area.

#### Scenario: Spacious Chart Layout
- **Given** the Relationship Chart is displayed
- **Then** the main排盘 panel MUST have significant internal padding (e.g., at least 6rem/96px on desktop).
- **And** the vertical distance between the "Heaven" and "Human" sections MUST be clearly defined (e.g., at least 8rem/128px).
